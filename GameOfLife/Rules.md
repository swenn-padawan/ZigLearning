The rules of this game is pretty simple.

It's a Simulation, every cells can only have 2 states, Alive or Dead. (Black or White)

Every cells interacts with their 8 neightbors, at each step of time the simulation update.

1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.

2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed system. The first step in the simulation start by appliying all of the aboves rules at each cells at the same time.
